Good solution for cases when you could not lock global config file .gitconfig: Permission denied – antongorodezkiy Jul 29 '15 at 23:03
  	 	
If you have Permission denied on .gitconfig there is something seriously ske*ed with your system. Your $HOME should be available to you (which is where .gitconfig should be, shouldn't it?). – mcepl Jul 30 '15 at 8:27
  	 	
This is not actually my server. But thank you anyways. And I removed path from error message, actually on that server git is trying to access .gitconfig somewhere in /var/www/... – antongorodezkiy Jul 30 '15 at 19:36
